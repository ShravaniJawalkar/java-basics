LRU - Least Recent Used. it work on the principle of checking history of usage where the item used very less
LFU - Least Frequently Used it works on the frequency of item use if it is used more frequently then it will be in cache.

FIFO - First In First Out it works on the principle of removing the item which is added first in cache.

Here is a list of questions to help you prepare for the level-up assessment for a senior software role with a focus on caching solutions. These questions cover theoretical concepts, practical knowledge, and implementation with the libraries/frameworks you mentioned.

Distributed and Local Caching Foundations:
General Questions on Caching:

What is caching, and why is it important in distributed systems?
caching is used to cache the static and most frequently used data which get change less frequently.
which improve application performance and response time.
it is important in distributed system because of fallowing
Improve performance and response time
in distributed architecture and microservice communicate with another microservice
so if we calling another microservice to get same data most of the time. then call to microservice take some time
because we need to communicate with it over network which add network latency
so using cache here to cache response can improve performance and response time

reduce load on backend service and database
sending call each time to service and database for complex queries which not change more frequently.
can add overhead on underline devices. so caching help here as well storing query data and service response locally
on calling service.

Bandwidth Optimization: services are communicate over network which add network latency. this can be reduce if
we use cache

fault tolerance and resilience = if backend service /underline service get fail the cache can be used as fallback response
for calling service.

Scalability - using distributed caching(redis cache multiple cluster or hazel cast) we can serve multiple request concurrently

CostSaving - as call not goes to underline resource each time the it reduce cpu utilization, memory utilization, reduce IO operation
result in cost saving

DataBase Query Aggregation - caching complex data base queries. help reduce query execution time.

Cache Usage
    1. WeApplication - caching static Data HTML,CSS,javascripts script.
    caching DB query
    2. Microservice - caching API response, caching complex db query result
    3. ecommerce app = caching product catalog and product details and price
Challenges in Cache
    StaleObject issue - if underline resource is update after cache population then it lead to inconsistent data state.
    receiver get inconsistent data.
    Eviction Issue:- as cache has limited memory size we need to Prioritize the data which one to keep and which one to remove.
    if proper eviction strategy not chosen then it can lead to cache thrashing(if cache get full then it will evict the entry automatically
    just before it require again meaning inconsistent eviction happen)
    Cache Miss issue = if required object is not present in cache then call goes to underline resource which can add latency.
    Complexity in distributed cache= as distributed cache has multiple node maintaining consistency across node is challenge.

What are the differences between local caching and distributed caching?
Local Cache
is in memory cache and store memory of single instance of application
Distributed cache - shared among multiple services of application. use centralize and distributed approach if distributed
maintain data consistency across all node
scalability :- we can horizontally scale distributed cache by adding more node. but this is not possible with local
cache as it is cache per instance stays in instance memory
data consistency - as distributed cache can have centralized and distributed approach all nodes of cache share and access
same data. so same data is available for multiple receiver.
in case of Local cache is cache per instance. change is this cache not reflects to other instance cache.
other instance cache may have stale data if this cache get updated.
performance -
Local cache provide higher performance as it is reside in memory of instance
Distributed cache slightly slower compare to local cache because we need to communicate with it over
network which add network latency.
scope and visibility
Local cache scope is limited to single instance of application. it is not visible to other instances
Distributed cache scope is global because it's data shared among multiple services and application
fault tolerance
Local cache if instance get down or crash the local cache will be lost because it reside in memory of instance
Distributed cache provide fault tolerance because if one node get down or lost due to some issue another node is available
which has consistent data.

example of Local cahce
ehcache
caffeine cache
guava cache

example of distributed cache
Redis cache
Memcached
Hazelcast

What factors should you consider when deciding whether to use caching in an application?
read vs write ratio - if reads are more frequent than writes then caching is beneficial
frequency of data access - how frequently that service is getting called if it is getting called frequently then caching is beneficial
data consistency requirement - if data get change frequently and required strong consistency then caching is not beneficial
data size = if data size is large then caching may not be beneficial as it can lead to memory overhead
concurrency and scalability requirement - if application need to scale horizontally then distributed cache is beneficial
data type = if static data which not change frequently then caching is beneficial
user experience requirement - if application need to provide fast response time then caching is beneficial
data access pattern - caching works well static and predictable data.
Type of Application:-  Real time, low latency application benefit from caching
Application where latency is not a concern and it's data access less frequent then caching is not beneficial
