Hereâ€™s a categorized list of potential interview questions:

Basic Questions:
What is logging, and why is it important in application development?
logging is used to record message and event when an application is running
message have details like error, warning, system performance, information details of application state.
logging framework help developer to write standard log message with structure data and output it on console and file
according to configuration
Benefits of logging

debugging and troubleshooting
    it help developer to find root cause of issue. by logging error and exception with stack trace

Monitoring and observability
it helps deveOps engineer to monitor application health and performance by logging metrics and events

Audit and compliance
useful for auditing sensitive actions(login attempt, payment processing) and maintaining compliance with regulations
in compliance strict environment logging is must
Performance analysis
it  logs time information of actions. ex. the time required to execute db query.
time taken for response from external api
service communication tracing
in distributed system. logging help to trace full request flow(how request get process from different service) with help of correlation id

Production incident investigation
in production incident investigation. logging plays important role.
it help to faster Identify root cause and immediate action to resolve issue

Security monitoring
it help in tracking malicious activity and unintended login attempts and we can monitor ang generates alerts due to this information

characteristics of good logging and best practices

Structured logging data : use Json format for logging the log message for better parsing and analysis
helps to integrate easily with centralized logging system like elk, splunk.

Logging level: INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, WARN, TRACE
use of proper logging level to log message is very important. in development use debug level to log detailed information.
in production use info error and warn level to log important information

Centralization:- consolidate logs from different service in distributed environment into centralize application like elk
for effective monitoring and analysis
Tracing and correlation id:-
in distributed system correlation id help to trace a full request flow across different service
Retention policy:- retain the log for specific time period as per compliance and business need
avoid logging sensitive data

What are the differences between System.out.println and a proper logging framework?
"Feature",        "System.out.println","Logging Framework"
"Logging Levels",        "No",          "Yes (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)"
"Output Destination",   "Console only",     "Console, files, streams, remote servers"
"Configuration",       "Hardcoded",        "Dynamic via configuration files"
"Performance",        "Blocking, poor for production",  "Optimized, supports async logging"
"Contextual Information (e.g., MDC)","Manual inclusion",  "Automatic, supports MDC/NDC"
"Scalability",         "Limited",                                 "Designed for large-scale systems"
"Stack Trace Logging",            "Manual formatting",         "Automatic formatting"
"Error Handling",         "Difficult",                         "Flexible and structured"

How do you configure java.util.logging in Java?
What are logging levels? Can you name common levels provided by logging frameworks? (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, etc.)
Intermediate Questions:
What is SLF4J, and how does it differ from Log4j or Logback?
Describe the concept of appends in logging frameworks like Logback or Log4j.
How do configuration files (e.g., XML or JSON) control logging behavior in Log4j or Logback?
How do you implement rolling logs in Logback or Log4j, and why is it useful?
What are MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) and NDC (Nested Diagnostic Context) in SLF4J or Logback? How are they used?
Advanced Questions:
What is asynchronous logging, and why is it beneficial? Which frameworks support it?
How would you configure SLF4J to work with Log4j or Logback in a Java application?
Compare Log4j 1.x vs. Log4j 2. Why should developers migrate to Log4j 2?
Explain the Log4Shell vulnerability. How can it be mitigated in Log4j?
What's the difference between a logging facade (like SLF4J) and a logging framework (like Logback)?
How would you dynamically change logging levels in a production environment without restarting the application?
Use Case or Scenario-based Questions:
If your application writes volume-heavy logs, how would you optimize its performance?
How would you implement different loggers for different modules or packages in a Java application?
A production system generates logs that are too noisy (large volume); what strategies would you propose to improve logging efficiency?
How would you implement centralized logging in a distributed microservices-based system?
You need to integrate an external library that uses java.util.logging, but your application uses SLF4J. How would you handle this?
Hands-On or Code-Oriented Questions:
Write a simple Java program using SLF4J with Logback as the logging backend.
Implement a custom appender for a logging framework (e.g., Log4j or Logback).
Demonstrate how to use MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) to enrich logs with contextual information like user ID.
Show how you would configure rolling file logs in either Log4j or Logback.
Create a JSON configuration for Log4j to log ERROR messages to a file and DEBUG messages to the console.
