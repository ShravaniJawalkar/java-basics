Why String is Immutable or Final in Java?
because string object value is get cached in string pool
if we use string literal it can be share between multiple client if one client or method change string literal value other also need to follow the same
but this not the case with String because it is immutable in nature once it's value initialze it can't get changed
so due to cache it improve performance and memory utilization

4. What is the difference between String on C and Java?

 Why char array is better than a String for storing passwords?
 as string are immutable in nature we can't erase it's content from memory
 but we can erase char array content from memory

 6. How do you compare two String in Java?
 equals(),equalsIgnoreCase()
 7. Can we compare String using == operator? What is the risk?
 if we compare it will compare it's reference which will not be same so it will return false
 so if want to compare if two strings are equal we need to use equalTo() method
