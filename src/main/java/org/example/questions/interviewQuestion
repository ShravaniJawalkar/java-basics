parallel stream
data sharding
java stream
internal working of hash map- how has collision happened , how hash-code is calculated. if map is full the how next capacity is cacluated to store new key value pair
write java code quick sort
write java code how to identify it is circular linked list

circular view error - it generally comes when there is bidirectional mapping between two entities.
suppose we have user and order entity
user has one-to-many relation with order
order has many-to one relation with user
so in this case if order tries to do getUser then it does try to do the serialization and deserialization of object which cause the recursive loop
to avoid this
we can use
JsonIgnore
JsonReference and JsonBack Reference
JsonIdentityInfo

different IOC containers in Spring Boot
Bean Factory Context
Application context does early loading for singletone bean. it handle aop and event propagation and context hierarchy.
WebApplicationContext- used case of web controllers. spring boot internally uses webApplicationContext which is child of application context
Spring Boot Application Startup flow
if there is no annotation provided on class will that class get load in IOC container
if external bean configuration not provided and haven't used any annotation then it will be not loaded in IOC container


why streams are lazy in nature.
because it is used to process data
it has a intermediate operation which is called by terminal operation
it only process the data you need.


when you will go with microservice and when you will go with monolithic
when you will go with reactive stream approach when you will go with normal stream. under the hood what it use
when we will use async and nonblocking async(message broker) explain use case
difference between sql and nosql db
why we use docker and what is kubernetes used for
