### **General Java Knowledge**
1. Can you explain the key features of Java?
        functional interface- consumer, supplier, function, predicate
        lambda expression-
        default, static methods in interface
        dateTime API- java.time.*. replaced java.util.Date, java.util.calender.
        optional API- to handle NullPointerException
        streamAPI-
2. What are the differences between Java 8 and Java 11 (or the latest version you're familiar with)?
java 11 feature
    ZGC garbage collection introduced
    local variable var
    string modernization - strip(), line(), repeat()
    Optional api method addition isEmpty.
    HTTP Client API- java.net.HttpClient replaced HttpUrlConnection

    java 21
        LTS support for 8+ years
        GC- Shenandoah ZGC
        Virtual Thread
        Record and switch pattern matching
        scoped value
        SequencedCollection


3. Describe the concept of "immutability" in Java. Why is the `String` class immutable?
    immutability meaning once it is initialised it can't be modified. String is immutable because it does cache pooling in string pool.
    suppose one method is accessing String object and trying to modify it then its reference will change not actual value. the actual value remains the same which will not affect other
    method execution which are using same String object.

4. What is the difference between `Checked` and `Unchecked` exceptions in Java?
checked exception - are compile time exception.
these exception we need need to define explicitly using Throws at method level
it is mandatory to handle it in try-catch block
ClassNotFound, IO exception, SQL Exception. extends Exception class
Unchecked- runtime exception. not mandatory to add try-catch or throws
extends RuntimeException class
NoClassDefError, NullPointer, Arithmetic Error
5. What are Java annotations, and how are they used in development?
@FunctionalInterface(Runtime,ClassLevel), @Override(Source,Method),SuppressWarning(Source),@Deprecate(Source,Method/Class)
 retention policy source , class, runtime
6. Explain the significance of the `final`, `static`, and `volatile` keywords in Java.
  final- final method can't be override
   final class can't be extended
   final data members are immutable
 Static -  static methods are loaded when class is loaded, called at class level does not need object to call, and can use static data members only.
   static data members are initialize at class level, can be access with class name if declare public. shared among the object if not final then the value change by one object
   visible to other. and can be access by static methods.
  Volatile - it is useful for multithreaded environment . to share data member among the thread. so its updated value visible to other thread. generally used for flags.
7. What is the purpose of Java’s garbage collector, and how does it work?
        Java garbage collector collect / reclaim the memory of unreachable object and free up it.
        internally there are different algorithm used for garbage collection according to java version
        but most general steps are. identify GC root( thread stack references and Global Variables)
        travers through the graph/heap for identify the live objects
        perform mark and sweep to objects
        and then perform compaction for avoiding memory fragmentation.
        heap memory divided into regions yong generation, old generation, metaspace(outside of heap has class metadata info and static variable, enums)
        StrongReference ,SoftReference, WeakReference.

8. Can you describe the differences between `==` and `.equals()` in Java?
== just math the object reference does not check/match the actual content of object. equal does
9. What are functional interfaces? Explain with examples of commonly used ones in Java 8.
which has only one abstract method
consumer
void accept(T t)
supplier
R r get()
function
R r apply(T t)
predicate
boolean test(T t)
---
class loader
BootStrapClass Load- load the classes present in class path
External or Platform class Loader- load the classes which are present in external dependency
Application class loader- load classes of current application
Association - relation between classes one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many,
Aggregation- has a relation
composition - part of relation
1. Can we serialize static variable? - no
2. How to serialize static variable? - serialize it value of static data member
use static getter and setter if data member private static
use custom serialize logic like writeForObject, readObject.
to make data member not part of serialization we can use transient keyword

### **Java Frameworks (Spring, Hibernate)**
10. What is the Spring Framework, and why is it widely used in Java development?
    for building entreprise application, web application development , microservice building.
    springMvc- web development
    springBoot- starter support
    SpringData- interaction with orm framework hibernate and JPA
    springsecurity
    springTest-
    aspectOrientedPropgraming
    SpringCloud
    TransactionSupport
    SpringDataCatch
    its Inversion of Control- which manage the bean creation in IOC container and injecting dependency . remove tight coupling.
11. Can you explain Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring and its benefits?
        it uses inversion of control mechanism
        here the IOC container manage the bean creation and adding external dependency to initialize given bean.
        ex
        engine
        in car class
        public Car(){
        this.engine=new Engine()// tightly coupled
        }
        if in future suppose the engine has a sub classes
        so we need to change the references of it in each an every file. it can lead consistency issue. and scaling issue as well

        constructor injection
        @Autowired
        Car(Engine e){
            engine=e;//loose coupling here dependency injected runtime
        }
        //setter injection
        public void setEngine(Engine e){
        this.e=e;
        }

        field injection -
        @Autowired
        private Engine engine;

        in spring framework we were using xml base configuration for bean creation and injection. but maintaining those file is cumbersome.

        so we used annotation based bean initialization and injection using @Autowired


        TDD and BDD
        Test driven development - it focusing on the writing test cases before functionality is even develop.
        it focuses on functionality. basically here developer is involved who writes the unit test cases.
        stages involved in TDD
        Red Stage:-
            here test case is written for the functionality that is not implemented yet
        Green Stage:-
            implement enough code for functionality so that test will pass
        Refactor stage:-
                refactor code according to new feature and additional functionality.
                this use for code maintainability. code coverage and line coverage.
        Repeat:-
                continue writing the next test. covers the edge cases, negative scenarios.

        Behaviour Driven Development:-
            focus on behavior of the application. focus on business aspect
            here collaboration happen between developer, tester/qa and non-technical stake holder
            focuses on what system does not how system does it. follow, Given-When-Then approach
            tool used is cucumber and gherkin.


12. Describe the Spring Bean lifecycle.
Application Start - Invoke Of IOC container(component scanning/configuration)- construct bean/instantiate a bean using default constructor or any given constructor config.
- dependency injection - bean initialization beanPostProcessorBeforeInitialize() and beanPostProcessAfterInitialize. - postConstruct() - useBean- preDestroy()-destroy()

13. What are Spring Boot starters? Can you name a few?
reduce boilerplate code
autoconfiguration feature
compacting multiple relatable and dependent dependency in single starter dependency
spring-boot-starter-web = spring core, embedded tomcat, spring web, jackson databind
spring-boot-starter-test = junit5, mockito, assert dependency
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa= jpa and hibernate dependency
spring-boot-starter = logging dependency, autoconfiguration dependency.
@SpringBootApplication= @Component,@EnableAutoConfiguration- scan all dependency form class path and external dependency to start application context(datasource,application.properties), @ComponentScan
14. Explain the differences between JPA, Hibernate, and JDBC.
Hibernate is ORM frame framework used to map JAVA objects to DB tables. underline it perform sql queries for the java methods written for the performing DB function
in hibernate we don't need to write the boilerplate code for connecting to DB
we just need to provide dataSource details either in application.properties
spring.datasource.url
spring.datasource.driverClassName
spring.datasource.username
spring.datasource.password
or either defined in App configuration
creating DataSource Object
and it support predefined method for saving data and fetching data from DB
save/persist, remove(), merge, flush, find(). provide transactional support but explicitly need to define it
with either @Transaction or by using programmatic transaction approach. support JPQL and we can specify the connection pool size.
no need to explicitly close connection.

JDBC- it's a abstraction layer between our DB driver and JAVA object act as bridge,
here in JDB lot of boilerplate code need to be run such as
for getting db connection
Class.forName("driver")
con.getConnection(url,username,password)
then write sql queries in prepare statement.
write result set object to fetch result
explicitly handle connection close
JPA- specification built a abstraction layer over orm Framework. provide abstract methods to perform db function. under the hood call orm framework only.
as it build on top of hibernate frame work. it is an interface.
methods are save, saveAll, findById, findAll these are predefine method. we can define custom methods as well
findUserByDepartmentId() internally it uses PartTree(spring.data) to parse the method and create sql query for the same.
by default provide transactional support for method save, saveAll and delete.
support JPQL and language which is DB platform independent. support pagination and sorting

15. How does Hibernate manage database transactions, and what are common pitfalls?
using @Transactional annotation and ProgrammaticTransaction
ProgrammaticTransaction:-
using TransactionTemplate(doInTransaction). and PlatformTransactionManager. DefaultTransactionDefinition.

16. What is the purpose of `SessionFactory` in Hibernate?
sessionFactory is one for one DataSource configuration
creation session object
thread-safe and share between session object
hold db configuration and metadata information
manage data base connection pools
provide second level cache.
17. How do you handle caching in Spring or Hibernate?
in hibernate each session object provide first level cache. and session is per http request / thread.
but we can enable second-level cache by defining use.second.level.cache in application.properties file. it will enable at
SessionFactoryLevel which will be share among the multiple session
we need
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa(hibernet jcache)
ehcache
javax-cache api
hibernet jcache
hibernet -> hibernet j cache-> javax-cache api -> ehcache
ehcache.xml
define region
timetolive
eviction strategy by default LRU
application.yml spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache
@cache(usage=ConcurrencyStrategy. , region="")
ConcurrencyStrategy= READ_ONLY, NON_STRICT_READ_WRITE, READ_WRITE, TRANSACTIONAL

in normal spring application we can define two types of cache
local cache and distributed cache
local cache is specific to that spring application/microservice
to setup it we need local cache
on heap - concurrent hashmap, ehcache, caffeineCache
off heap- ehcache, caffeineCache
implementation
spring-boot-starter-cache
javax-cache-api
ehcache
ehcache.xml- define eviction strategy, time to live and OnHeapSize
@cachePut - each time call to underline resource and update the cache
,
@cacheable - first time call to underline resource and update cache. next time data fetch from cache,
@cacheEvict - remove entry from cache.

on entity class de
in Hibernate we need to enable the second level cache by given property
use
18. What are some common annotations used in Spring (e.g., `@RestController`, `@Repository`)? Explain their purpose.

### **RESTful APIs and Web Services**
19. What is REST, and how does it differ from SOAP? Why is REST preferred for modern web services?
REST is light weight api that support HTTP protocol
JSON,HTML and XML response type.
stateless
cache control
client-server architecture
properly resource exposed
usage of HTTP method
SOPA-> support XML. support both session/stateful and stateless
Support HTTP,SMTP,FTP different protocol
Support ACID transaction, WS security.

20. How do you implement a REST API in a Spring Boot application?
using Feign Client. where spring-cloud-starter-openFeign
21. Explain the different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and where they are typically used in REST.
22. How do you handle exceptions for RESTful services in Spring?
23. What HTTP response codes are commonly used in REST APIs, and when should you use them?
1xx - 100 informational
2xx- success 200 ok
201(created)
202(accepted)
204(no-content)-delete
206-partial content
redirection 3xx = 301(move permanently)
302 = move temporary
client error 400(bad request), 401(unauthorized), 403(forbidden), 404(Not found), 405(method not allowed)
server side error 500(Internal server error), 501(Not implemented), 502(bad gateway), 503(service unavailable), 504(gateway time out)

24. How do you secure REST APIs? Can you explain how OAuth2 or JWT works?
spring security

### **Database Technologies (SQL, NoSQL, PLSQL)**
25. What are the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases? When would you choose one over the other?
26. What is a join in SQL? Could you explain the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN?
27. Can you write a SQL query to retrieve duplicate records from a table?
select username, count(*) as duplicate from user group by username having count(*) >1;
28. How do transactions in SQL databases work, and what is the significance of ACID properties?
begin
commit;
rollback;
29. What are stored procedures and functions in PL/SQL? When would you use them?
procedure are written for DML operations, does not return value directly return value indirectly with out parameter
can not be used with select statement.
usage of procedure
when we want to perform list of DML operation.
such as validating, Updating the record and logging
performing complex transaction logic for operations
procedure can be directly call by web-application adn microservice to perform the DB operations
functions are used to perform computation/calculation and data transformation.
it returns value with RETURN directly(single or multiple)
used with select statement
both can be used - Maintainability(modular code) , improve performance(precompile set of queries). Encapsulation of Logic,reusability( those functions can be reuse)
30. How do you handle performance optimization for database queries?
using index for query result which are fetched multiple times and the updates for that result are less.
selection of index :-  index b+ tree index for general lookup and bitmap index for the column which has less distinct value.
add index on composite key
avoid more usage of sub quires.
avoid using select *
use where instead of having.
31. What is indexing in SQL, and how does it help performance?

### **Development Tools and Build Tools**
32. How do you use IntelliJ IDEA for Java development?
33. What are the differences between Maven and Gradle? Which one do you prefer and why?

phases
validate-
compile
test
package
verification
install
deploy
gradle build is incremental. it use groovy script/kotlin that can be use with multiple language. python, java nodejs
incremental builds
build caching
support both imperative and declarative build
multi project build support
write custom task
34. What are build profiles in Maven, and how are they used?
so profile is useful when we want to run different configurations according to different environment
<profiles><profile>
<id>dev</id>
<properties></properties>
</profile></profiles>
35. Can you create a custom task in Gradle? Provide an example.
yes
task greet{
    ext.person='word'
    doLast{
        println "Hello, ${person}!"
    }
}
