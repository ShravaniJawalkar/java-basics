Tips for Preparation
Hands-On Practice:

Set up simple projects experimenting with major logging frameworks like Log4j, Logback, and SLF4J.
Try creating appenders, using MDC/NDC, and configuring rolling policies.
Understand Centralized Logging:

Read about tools like ElasticStack (ELK) or Splunk, which can aggregate and analyze logs from distributed systems.
Performance and Best Practices:

Learn about optimizing logging libraries using asynchronous logging or log buffer flushing.
Avoid logging sensitive information (secure audit logging practices).
Error Handling:

Learn how logging integrates with exception handling in Java and how to capture full stack traces effectively.
By mastering these topics and questions, youâ€™ll be well-prepared for logging-related sections in senior-level Java software engineering interviews.
